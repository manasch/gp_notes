#### Seperation of behaviour
- Let certain classes do the management of data, so the guys who manage data are not interlinked with guys who manipulate data.
- Let the algorithms and containers be seperate.
This provides some advantages:
1. Encapsulation
2. Reusability
3. `<placeholder>`

Container: Collects objects together
- Organization
- Standardization
- Abstraction

Adapter: Wrappers around containers, 2 widely used ones; queue and stack.

2 types of containers:
- Sequence containers
- Associative containers
---
- Front and back give first and last value respectively.
- Begin and end give pointers to first and last+1 respectively.


#### Sequence containers
#### `std::vector<T>`
- Vector of custom T requires  T having overloaded `==` and `!=` for **meaningful** work.
- Nested vectors are allowed.

#### `std::deque<T>`
- vector of vectors
- faster insertion at the front
- slower random access
