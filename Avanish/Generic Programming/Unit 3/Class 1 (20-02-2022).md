## STL
Containers, iterators and algorithms.
- STL is mad lightweight
- Prevents unsafe actions
- Code is **regular** (exposing only what is required, classes have defaults, copy etc constructors; same interface provided for everything)
- Math like (?????)
- Seperation in the concepts of algorithm and container
- Iterators are classes defined within objects which work as pointers, but aren't pointers


Generic programming: Lifting an algorithm, going from concrete to abstract

###### Fun Trivia
```cpp
a++++;     //not valid, error: lvalue required as increment operand
++++a;     //all good
```
