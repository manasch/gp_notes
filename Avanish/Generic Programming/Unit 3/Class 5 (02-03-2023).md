### Vector funny business

- Pushing objects into a vector is done by value, not by reference.
- If Derived is pushed into a `Vector<Base>` , elements use Base functionality.
- Reserve to speed up insertion.
- swap is memcopy, can be used to trim the fat in a vector by swapping with a new copied vector.
- Assign is a memcopy, hence faster
- Insert doesn't do the check


## Iterator
---
- Create, dereference, increment, compare
- Iterators let us view structures linearly
- Map iterators specifically are pairs
-  5 types of iterators: 
	1. Input: `int val = *itr;`
	2. Output: `*itr = val*;`
	3. Forward
	4. Bidirectional
	5. Random access: `itr = itr + 3;`
