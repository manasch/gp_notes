### Java basics
- Null is a special type, void is not a type.

##### You can do this retarded stuff in Java as well
```java
Child a = new Parent();
Grandchild b = a;
```

- All java objects extend big man `Object`
- Object header stores metadata
	- Mark Word contains info regarding objecto sync, biased clocking, garbage collection and age.
	- Class Pointer points to the class data of the object, includes names superclasses methods etc.
- Instance data contains actual data of the object, instance variables.
- Padding is added to align the object with the machine's word size, to improve perfomance.
- Method area stores class-level information such as class name, superclass, interfaces, constants, static variables, and method bytecode. each class loaded by the jvm has a single entry in the method area.
- Heap stores objects and their instance variables. the heap is managed by the garbage collector, which reclaims memory when objects are no longer in use.
