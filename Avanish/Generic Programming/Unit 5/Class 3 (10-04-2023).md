## C\#
- No pointers by default, can be used if under `unsafe`
- `int`, `string`, `double` are basic types
- Boxing is automatic, typecasting needs to be done during unboxing
- Generics (templates) can be used with Class, Structures, Interfaces, Delegates, and Methods. Delegates are function pointers.
- Generic types can be commpiled into dll files
```c#
public class Stack<T> where T: new()
```
- Enforces T having a public parameterised constructor
```c#
public class SceneGraph<T> where T: a
```
- Enforces T implementing a
```c#
default(T)
```
- Returns the default value for T
- Ref is similar to &
```c#
MyClass<Derived> md;
Myclass<Base> nd = md
```
- Can't do this (called covariance)
- Reflection
