- Templates are compiled into bytecode
- There is no template instantiation, new bytecode is generated  for each type

- String is a subtype of object, `List<string>` is not a subtype of `List<Object>`

```java
List myList = new LinkedList();
```
- Don't do this, raw types are bad practice, use `LinkedList<Object>` instead.


```java
WildcardClass<?> wc1 = new WildcardClass<>("Hello");
WildcardClass<?> wc2 = new WildcardClass<>(123);
```
- `?` represents Object + some special non objects
```java
<? extends Integer>
<T extends Integer>
```
- T would only take Integer, ? would work as a wildcard
