# Template Metaprogramming
- Programs dealing with other programs as data
- No mutability (no variables)
- Only at compile time, no run time stuff; hence no runtime polymorphism
- Metafunctions are normal templatized classes where the arguements are supplied as template parameters
- constexpr will evaluate at compile time as much as possible
- passing a variable arguement will make it calculate at runtime

`return (n < = 1) ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);`
