Write your function for the following.
a) count occurrence of a value
b) rightmost find
c) min
d) max

template<typename ptr1_t, typename ptr2_t>
bool are_equal(ptr1_t first1, ptr1_t last1, ptr2_t first2, ptr2_t last2)
{
// TODO
} 
Test whether the given two sequences have the same elements
should the two containers be of the same type?
should we require 4 parameters?
Test your code with
	array with array
	array with vector
	vector with list

-------------------------
template<typename ptr1_t>
bool is_sorted(ptr1_t first1, ptr1_t last1)
{
// TODO
}
check whether the elements in ascending order


sort an array of dates 
	in the order of month
	in the reverse chronological order
	
sort an array of Persons
	in order of name
	in reverse order of age
	
sort an array of int based on digital sum


a) Develop vector of person's name and date of birth.
Develop map of month and # of people born in that month

b) create a map of author's name(string) and a vector of his books.
Display all.
Find the number of books of each of the authors.
Find the author who has the highest # of books

c) create a map of map of vector : lang => author => title.
Develop functions to play with them.
