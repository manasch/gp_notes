while(first != last)

}

undefined behaviour of the range defined by the iterator has odd # of elements
undefined behaviour of the range defined by the iterator has even # of elements
will always terminate after executing the body of the loop half the # of elements times
none of these


while(first != last && *first != t)
{
	++*first;
}

will exit if first = last in the beginning
will exit if the first element becomes equal t after a  few increments
will be an undefined behaviour if t < *first as the loop is entered
none of these
