Finding mid point in vector 

has to be a linear algorithm
can be const time
is logarithmic
none of these

Finding distance between two iterators is

linear in list iterators and linear in vector iterators
linear in list iterators and const time in vector iterators
const time in list iterators and const time in vector iterators
none of these
