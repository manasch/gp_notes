which of the following is true?

move ctor provides a place holder where stealing of resource can be implemented
move ctor automatically provides stealing of resource
destructor is not called on the object passed as argument to move ctor as
	the object is no more active
move ctor is a class requires that we also implement move dtor

class A
{
	private:
	int a1;
	int a2;
};
void foo(A&& rhs);
This does not imply

that rhs can be changed
that fields in rhs (like a1 and a2) can be changed
that the function should be invoked using move on the argument of type A
that rhs is a rvalue
