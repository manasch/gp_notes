Generic Programming:
Project Component : 20 points
- possible ideas :
	implement a data structure
	implement iterator
	make this work with algorithms
	
	or
	
	implement an algorithm
	make this work with iterators of different builtin data structures
	
	
- team size : 3 or 2
- submit by next week :
	team (names of members)
	abstract (5 to 10 lines)
- evaluation :
	any time before the final day of ESA
	give a demo (max 10-15 min)
	will suggest changes
	complete in the next two hours and resubmit
	
- deliverables :
	share the code
	share a readme file (100 lines)
