min_element returns the position of the smallest in the range - could be based
on a predicate. The algorithm is linear. 
So,

The predicate should be unary
The predicate should be binary
Need not be a predicate - could be any functor
returns the smallest element


What is true of adjacent_difference?

requires 2 arguments
can have a unary predicate
0th element of output is same as the 0th element of input
0th element of output is difference of 1st and 0th elements of input
