Box b = new Box();
b.put(25);
int x = b.get();

class Box
{
	private Object o;
	public Object get() { return o; }
	public void put(Object o) { this.o = o; } 
}
Comment about the line : int x = b.get();

x becomes 25
x will refer to a location on the heap which is 25
This statement generates a runtime error
CCC None of these  

----------

class Box<T>
{
	private T o;
	public T get() { return o; }
	public void put(T o) { this.o = o; } 
}

		Box<String> s = new Box<String>();
		s.put(25);
		String s1 = s.get();
		
s1 becomes 25
s.get() requires casting to string
s.put(25); generates runtime error
CCC s.put(25); generates compile time error

class R
{
	public int zzz
	{
		get
		{
			return 1729;
		}
	}
}
Which of the following is correct?

R().zzz

delegate void fnptr_t()
This implies that

fnptr_t is callable
fn_ptr_t() is callable
fn_ptr_t f;  f is callable
CCC static void f() { } ; fn_ptr_t f = new fn_ptr_t(f); f is callable
