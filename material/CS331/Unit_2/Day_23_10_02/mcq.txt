class Ex;
Ex()(); // this compiles

This implies that the class Ex

has a default ctor and not function call operator
has no default ctor and has function call operator
has both default ctor and function call operator
cannot decide

template<typename T>
void myswap(T& x, T& y)
{
	T temp; temp = x; x = y; y = temp;
}
The requirements on type T are

assignment and default ctor
assignment and copy ctor
copy ctor and default ctor
default ctor and relation operator for equality
