Implement a list class. Implement iterator with in.
- make acc work with this class.

Implement the following functions.
- accumulate (reduce elements to a single element between a pair of iterators)
- find a position between a pair of iterators - compare for equality
- find the position of an element greater than a given element between
	a pair of iterators
- copy elements between a pair of iterators to another container

Try for both the vector and the list.
