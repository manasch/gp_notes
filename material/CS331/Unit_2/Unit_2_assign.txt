1. create a class MyVector.
   It should have 
   int n_;
   int* p_;
   In the constructor, allocate a block of n int to p.
   Provide ctors, dtor, assignment op and copy constructor.
   Write functions to add vectors.
   
2. create a class MyMatrix.
	It shold have
	int m_;
	int n_;
	int *p_;
   In the constructor, allocate a block of m X n int to p.
   Provide ctors, dtor, assignment op and copy constructor.
   Write functions to add matrices.	
Implement a list class. Implement iterator with in.
- make acc work with this class.

Implement the following functions.
- accumulate (reduce elements to a single element between a pair of iterators)
- find a position between a pair of iterators - compare for equality
- find the position of an element greater than a given element between
	a pair of iterators
- copy elements between a pair of iterators to another container

Try for both the vector and the list.
