so far:
unit 2:
class : fundamental operators
		parameter passing and return from member functions
		concept of const
			const variable
			const parameter
			const return
			const member function
		operator functions
		single argument constructor : explicit
------------

operator functions:
	syntactic sugar
	still a function
	never intent operator
	change the behaviour of builtin types
	precedence, association and rank/arity as in C++
	a few operators of C++ can be overloaded
