class A
{
	public:
	A& operator=(A&) const;
};

Signature of assignment operator
 
is fine
cannot change the lhs of assignment
cannot change the rhs of assignment
cannot return by reference


A& foo()
{
	return ___;
}

return could be followed by for correct semantics

any object
local object
static object
none of these
