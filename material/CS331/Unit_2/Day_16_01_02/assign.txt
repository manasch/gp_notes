1. create a class MyVector.
   It should have 
   int n_;
   int* p_;
   In the constructor, allocate a block of n int to p.
   Provide ctors, dtor, assignment op and copy constructor.
   Write functions to add vectors.
   
2. create a class MyMatrix.
	It shold have
	int m_;
	int n_;
	int *p_;
   In the constructor, allocate a block of m X n int to p.
   Provide ctors, dtor, assignment op and copy constructor.
   Write functions to add matrices.
