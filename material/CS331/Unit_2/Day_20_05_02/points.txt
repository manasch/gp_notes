Generic Programming : day 20 : 5th Feb 2021
so far:
	class
	fundamental operators
	member functions - parameter passing and return
	constness
	operator function
	single arg ctor - explicit
	friend function
friend function :
	another interface of the class
	seldom have friends
	use friend function:
		operator does not require an object on the left 
		position of operand is not right 
		when convention demands
		
// Scott Meyers : Effective C++
// Cline and Marshll : C++ FAQ
----------------------------------
friend class : friend class and friend function : orthogonal
----------------------------------

operator functions:
=  : assignment : member
arithmetic operators : + - * / % : friend
+= -= ... : member
++ -- : member
relational operators : < <= > >= == != : friend
& | ^ << >> ~ : friend
&= ... : member
logical operator : && ||   : NO
logical operator : !  member
sizeof typeid : NO
?: : NO
operator new, operator delete : yes
-> * : members
:: .   NO; compile time operators
------------------------------
The C puzzle book : Feuer
------------------------------
int a; int b;
a = 10;
b = a * a ++;  // 110 or 100 : unspecified
	10	10
	11 

b is 100 101 110

x + y * z
evaluation of expr:
1. evaluation of operands
	fetching operands to the registers of the CPU
2. evaluation of operators
	precedence
	association
a + a * a : how many times should we load a?
C/C++ : order of eval of operands is not defined
JAVA : always left to right

sequence point: guarantees all side effects shall be complete

a = 1;
a || --a

|| : sequence point
1 || 0 => true
a++ + a : not specified
a++ || a : well defined
