Generic Programming : day 24: 11th Feb 2021

so far:
class
fundamental operators
operator function
friend function
callback : pointer to function or functor (object of a class
	supporting the function call operator)
	
differences between call thro pointer to function and call thro functor

1. pointer to function
a)
	compiler cannot decide which fn is getting called
	runtime mechanism
	code cannot be inlined
b)  has no state info	
	
2. functor
a) 
	compiler can makeout which fn is getting called
	resolution is at compile time
	code can be inlined
b) can have state info
