Discuss the return mechanism.
	when to return by value
	when to return by reference
	when to return by reference to const?
	
if the class contains a file descriptor field,
and a file is opened in the ctor and closed in the dtor
	what happens on default assignment?
	what happens if we call dup in the assignment operator?
