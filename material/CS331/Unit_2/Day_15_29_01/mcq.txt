void foo(const int& );
Which of the following will not compile?

const int a(10); foo(a);
int a(10); foo(a);
const int a; foo(a);
int a; foo(a);

class A
{
	char a[20];
};

Assume these objects have been initialized suitably.
A a1("rama"); A a2("krishna");
what happens if we have the statement
a2 = a1;

compile time error; arrays cannot be assigned
dangling pointer
garbage leading memory leak
none of these
