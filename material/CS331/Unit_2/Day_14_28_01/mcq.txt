class A
{
	A(int = 1, int = 2);
};

A a1(10, 20); is ok
A a2(30); is ok
A a3;  is ok
none of these

class A
{
	public:
	A(char *p = 0);
	~A();
};

A::A(char *p) : p_(p) { }
A::~A() { delete p_; }

delete p_ deletes whatever p points to - no matter to which segment p points to.
delete p_ fails if p_ is initialized to 0
delete p_ fails if p_ points to location on the heap
none of these
