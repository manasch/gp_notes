  C : functional ? NO
- C : object oriented ?
  directly no
  implement OO concepts as a design pattern in 'C'

Object Oriented concepts:
Interface and implementation:
Interface, once published, cannot be withdrawn
withdrawing will break the existing code
becomes a maintenance nightmare

1. Abstraction :
	selecting what is essential
	ignoring what is not essential
	depends on the observer
	
	also give a name for it
	
2. encapsulation :
	put things together
	put attributes and behaviour together
	
	hide what could change
	expose what should not change
	
	hide the implementation
	expose the interface
	
	not a security concept
