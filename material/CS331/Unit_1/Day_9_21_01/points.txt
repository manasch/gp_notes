Generic Programming : day 9 : 21st Jan 2021
queries:

could you please check if these are the right answers for mcq.txt?
1. b) pointer to a
        //Sir, what does line-3 do?
2. c) 1000 + sizeof(int) * 5

in qb.txt, is this right for the first question?
1. distinguish value and reference semantics
In a Reference Semantics expression, the arguments refer to the original objects.
While, in a Value Semantics expression, the arguments refer to copies of the values in the objects.

reference semantics for equality : references should refer to the same object
value semantics for equality : referrents are compared


so far,
template functions
implicit instantiation
explicit instantiation
specialization 
	no partial specialization C+ 2020
