template<typename T1, typename T2>
T2 foo(T1 t1)
{
	// ...
}
which of the following will compile?

foo(10);
foo<int>(10);
foo<double, int>(10);
foo(10, 2.5);

----------------

template<typename T>
T foo(T x)
{
	return *x * *x;
}

For this work,

the type T should support multiplication and dereferencing
the type T should support dereferencing and T* should support multiplication
the type to which T points to should support multiplication and dereferencing
none of these
