1. when to use templates and when to use overloading?
2. Observe the name mangling of 
	normal functions
	and those created by the template mechanism.
	Why that difference?
3. Can we declare a template function in header,
   define in an implementation file and invoke in 
   another translation?
   Give reasons.
