Inheritance 
Doesn’t matter if the func is private in the base class, the derived class can make it public when it calls it.
Class Derived: public Base{}

When using templates, derived cant call the base class functions the same way.
Need to do Base<T>::func()

-----
Child class can have more template parameters than the parent class.
-----
Specialized Base class 
Can a templatized derived class inherit from a normal base class? Yes
Class Nontemplate
{}

template <typename T>
class Derived : public Nontemplate 
{
	T…
}

Template inheritance
//cant inherit a function or a variable
You can inherit a template if it’s a class
Class Named : public T // the T has to be a class
